# OpenShift Console Troubleshooting Panel Plugin

This plugin is used to add the Troubleshooting Panel to view Korrel8r data. It is currently under construction and shows a new tab under observe.

## Docker image

Before you can deploy your plugin on a cluster, you must build an image and
push it to an image registry.

1. Build the image:

   ```sh
   docker build -t quay.io/my-repository/troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin:latest -f Dockerfile.dev .
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > On some systems with a low `ulimit nofile` limit you may need to increase the number of open files per thread to allow for the `npm ci` to run correctly by adding `--ulimit nofile=10000:10000 -t` to the command.

2. Run the image:

   ```sh
   docker run -it --rm -d -p 9001:80 quay.io/my-repository/troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin:latest
   ```

3. Push the image:

   ```sh
   docker push quay.io/my-repository/troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin:latest
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have a Mac with Apple silicon, you will need to add the flag`--platform=linux/amd64` when building the image to target the correct platform to run in-cluster.

## Deployment on cluster

A [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart is available to deploy the plugin to an OpenShift environment.

The following Helm parameters are required:

`plugin.image`: The location of the image containing the plugin that was previously pushed

Additional parameters can be specified if desired. Consult the chart [values](charts/openshift-console-plugin/values.yaml) file for the full set of supported parameters.

### Installing the Helm Chart

Install the chart using the name of the plugin as the Helm release name into a new namespace or an existing namespace as specified by the `plugin_console-plugin-template` parameter and providing the location of the image within the `plugin.image` parameter by using the following command:

```shell
helm upgrade -i troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin charts/openshift-console-plugin -n troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin --create-namespace --set plugin.image=quay.io/my-repository/troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin:latest
```

## Development

### Dependencies

1. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. [oc](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/4.4/)
3. [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
4. An OpenShift 4.16 cluster
5. [Korrel8r](https://korrel8r.github.io/korrel8r) instance running in the cluster.

#### TP (Troubleshooting Panel) Development Server

The development server of the troubleshooting panel can either be ran as a nodejs server to get hot reloading of the frontend or a go server to serve the files as they will be in production.

##### Javascript Development Server

In one terminal window, run:

1. `make install-frontend`
2. `make start-frontend`
   The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9002 with CORS enabled.

##### Go Server

In one terminal window, run:

1. `make build-frontend`
2. `make start-backend`
   Or for hot reloading of the go backend you can use [gow](https://github.com/mitranim/gow)
3. `gow run ./cmd/plugin-backend.go -port='9002' -config-path='./web/dist' -static-path='./web/dist'`
   Gow will restart when any changes are saved to go files in any subdirectories.

#### Monitoring Plugin Development Server

In another terminal window:
Clone https://github.com/openshift/monitoring-plugin into a new directory.
Then run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`
   The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.

#### Connect to Korrel8r

##### Setting up Korrel8r

The following steps are suggested for setting up Korrel8r within your cluster to test the plugin. These steps are accurate as of the time of writing, and both Korrel8r and this plugin are subject to change.

1. Clone the [korrel8r](https://github.com/korrel8r/korrel8r) repository into a new directory.
2. cd into `/hack/openshift`
3. Run `make operators`
4. Run `make resources`
5. Install the **korrel8r** operator into your cluster
6. Create a `korrel8r` namespace in your cluster
   a. If installing in 4.15 or later, there is a permission issue which can be tracked here: https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OU-304. To solve this follow the instructions detailed in the [docs](https://korrel8r.github.io/korrel8r/#troubleshooting-ocp-415-errors)

```bash
kubectl label ns/korrel8r pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged --overwrite
kubectl label ns/korrel8r pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn=privileged --overwrite
```

7. Create a korrel8r instance in the `korrel8r` namespace with the name `korrel8r`
8. Follow the instructions [here](https://korrel8r.github.io/korrel8r/#troubleshooting-no-related-logs) to create a failing deployment to create alerts which link to other items using korrel8r

##### Port Forward to Korrel8r

In order to test the plugin with the Korrel8r data, you need to port forward to the korrel8r pod.
In a another terminal window, run:

1. `make start-forward`
   The port forward runs on port localhost:9005 and forwards to the korrel8r pod. Defaults to a name of korrel8r in the namespace of korrel8r, but KORREL8R_NAME and KORREL8R_NAMESPACE variables can be set to adjust the location.

#### Console Development Server

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `npm run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/observe/alerts> and select an alert to see the running plugin.

#### Running start-console with Apple silicon and podman

If you are using podman on a Mac with Apple silicon, `npm run start-console`
might fail since it runs an amd64 image. You can workaround the problem with
[qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) by running
these commands:

```bash
podman machine ssh
sudo -i
rpm-ostree install qemu-user-static
systemctl reboot
```

### i18n

You can use the `useTranslation` hook with the `plugin__troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin` with this namespace as follows:

```tsx
const Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation("plugin__troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin");
  return <h1>{t("Hello, World!")}</h1>;
};
```

For labels in `console-extensions.json`, you can use the format
`%plugin__troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin~My Label%`. Console will replace the value with
the message for the current language from the `plugin__troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin`
namespace. For example:

```json
{
  "type": "console.navigation/href",
  "properties": {
    "id": "troubleshooting-panel",
    "name": "%plugin__troubleshooting-panel-console-plugin~Korrel8r%",
    "href": "/observe/korrel8r",
    "perspective": "admin",
    "section": "observe"
  }
}
```

Running `npm run i18n` updates the JSON files in the `locales` folder of the
plugin template when adding or changing messages.

### Linting

This project adds prettier, eslint, and stylelint. Linting can be run with
`npm run lint`.

The stylelint config disallows hex colors since these cause problems with dark
mode (starting in OpenShift console 4.11). You should use the
[PatternFly global CSS variables](https://patternfly-react-main.surge.sh/developer-resources/global-css-variables#global-css-variables)
for colors instead.

The stylelint config also disallows naked element selectors like `table` and
`.pf-` or `.co-` prefixed classes. This prevents plugins from accidentally
overwriting default console styles, breaking the layout of existing pages. The
best practice is to prefix your CSS classnames with your plugin name to avoid
conflicts. Please don't disable these rules without understanding how they can
break console styles!
